The calculation is based on Equation (12).

Initially, the spin points along the +x direction, and so does the
magnetic field.  Then, the magnetic field begins to slowly rotate.  In
the adiabatic limit, where the magnetic field vector changes slowly
compared to the Larmor frequency, the spin is dragged along with the
magnetic field.

This program compares the actual spin dynamics with the adiabatic
limit.
